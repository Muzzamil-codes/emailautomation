  "subject_line": "Quick Question",
  "email_body": "Hi [Tea World Owner Name],\n\nI was looking for Restaurants in Doha and came across Tea World. Impressive presence on Talabat with a 4.5 rating!\n\nI noticed a lower recommendation rate on Facebook, which could be impacting customer trust. A website built to impress and convert could address that, and provide a better ordering experience than Talabat alone, and give you full control over your branding.\n\nWould you be open to a quick call to see how a brand-aligned website could fix these problems and grow your business? I can even show you a free demo website to get you started. \n\nThanks,\n[Your Name]",
  "follow_up_notes": "- Highlight the ROI of a website in terms of increased online orders and reduced reliance on third-party platforms like Talabat (reduced commission fees).\n- Discuss how a website can showcase Tea World's unique offerings and brand story, differentiating them from competitors like Tea Time.\n- Mention the potential for SEO to drive more organic traffic to their website and increase brand visibility in the Doha market. \n- Show examples of websites we've built for other restaurants in Qatar and their results."
